# Alfred's Meal

Building AI course project

## Summary

This project consists of an AI software that eases the time consuming process of meal planning. It aims to automate the design of meal calendars, taking into account aspects such as cost, prefered diet, health conditions and time. Thus, it serves as an AI butler (therefore Alfred's Meal) that generates meal plans and advises where to buy the ingredients required.

## Background

This will aim to solve the unnecesary ammount of time that many individuals have to invest, in order to make sure that their needs are met. Specially, in households where there are not years of experience in this task this could be a huge issue (i.e. university students or recently married couples). Many will most probably empathize with this situation, including me. Thus, it could help tremendously to optimize the task, even to those who have plenty of experience doing it.  

## How is it used?

It would be used on an application built to integrate the assistant. The user will be able to visualize their meal plan generated, and a shopping list will be generated as well with the ingredients (with specific amounts) required to make the different dishes. The user will also be able to create their own dishes, with instructions, or use the ones provided by Alfred. And, there will be a section where the prefered criteria can be selected so that Alfred takes decisions based on them. For example, is the cost of the dishes the number one priority, or is it having hihg-protein dishes in the morning, or both.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data will be collected from users, their guidelines (external data), and recipes websites. From them, their satisfaction with the plans generated, thus classifications methods will be needed. Their guidelines, their location, and preferences, which might be require some unsupervised methods. And, websites with recipes, and also the user's recipes, to generate inputs, which will probably require supervised learning.
